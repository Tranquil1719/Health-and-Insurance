 ##**Dashboard Insight**
The interactive dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the demographic structure, health risk patterns, healthcare utilization, and financial performance of the insured population.


-------

##**Overall Conclusion from the Dashboard**
The dashboard reveals that the insured population is largely young, urban, and economically active, but with emerging lifestyle-related health risks such as overweight BMI, smoking history, and alcohol usage. High-risk individuals account for a disproportionate share of medical costs and hospitalizations. Financial analysis indicates that the insurance portfolio is currently stable, but strategic adjustments in pricing, plan design, preventive healthcare programs, and rural outreach are necessary to ensure long-term sustainability.
